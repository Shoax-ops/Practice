    <h1>Hi Amber,</h1>
    <p>I just wanted to say.....</p>
    <h2>I want to sincerely apologize for my actions and any pain I may have caused you. You mean so much to me, and the thought of having hurt someone I deeply care about weighs heavily on my heart. I’ve been reflecting on everything we’ve shared, and I truly miss our moments together—our late-night study sessions filled with laughter and focus, our sweet ice cream dates where we’d talk about life and dreams, and especially the quiet, sacred times we spent sharing scriptures and uplifting each other in faith. Those moments weren’t just routines; they were treasures to me, and I realize now how much I took them for granted. I miss your presence, your wisdom, and the genuine connection we’ve built. I’m truly sorry, and I hope, in time, I can earn back your trust and find my way back to your friendship. Please dont be scared to text me when u feel like you have had the space you said you need.</h2>
