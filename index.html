          <p>Dear Avuswa and Precious,  

Today is such a beautiful and special day, because it marks the beginning of a new chapter in your lives â€” your twenties! Stepping into this season is more than just celebrating another year; itâ€™s stepping into womanhood with greater purpose, grace, and strength.  

You are both radiant, gifted, and filled with so much potential. My prayer is that this year brings you closer to Godâ€™s heart, that you may always walk in His light, and that His blessings may overflow in every area of your lives. May your twenties be a decade of growth, discovery, love, joy, and endless victories.  

As you journey ahead, may you rise to every challenge with courage, and embrace every blessing with gratitude. May your hearts always remain soft, your dreams always remain big, and your faith always remain unshaken.  

Avuswa and Precious, you are deeply loved and celebrated today. Iâ€™m so proud of the women youâ€™re becoming, and I canâ€™t wait to see how brightly youâ€™ll shine. May this birthday be just the beginning of countless beautiful moments, breakthroughs, and testimonies in your lives.  

Happy Birthday, young queens ðŸŽ‰ðŸ‘‘ May your twenties be unforgettable and full of grace!
